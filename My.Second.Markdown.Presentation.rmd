## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
gm = read_csv("gapminder.csv")
# controlling the size of printing
gm %>% 
  filter (continent == "Asia") %>% 
  print (n = 10)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# Continuous X and Y 
# map `gdpPercap` on to x-axis and `LifeExp` into y-axis
p = gm %>% 
   ggplot (aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp)) 
p # p just gives canvas

# add geom_point to P
 p + geom_point()
 
# try log scale
p= p + scale_x_log10() # modify canvas
p+geom_point()

# color by continent
p+geom_point(aes(col=continent))

# Palettes can be modified

# color blue
p+geom_point(col = "blue", pch=17, size=8, alpha=0.2)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
